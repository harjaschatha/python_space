AN UNFORGETTABLE DAY IN THE LIFE OF
ST. STEPHEN’S COLLEGE

DISMISSAL SERVICE 2013

This was like nothing else ever before beheld in the College! Nearly 350 graduating students, all
in their academic robes, standing in solemn dignity and pledging themselves to honouring the
spirit and ethos of St. Stephen’s College, to putting ‘service before self’ and to proving
themselves responsible citizen of India!
The occasion?
Dismissal Service 2013.
In the wake of a sincere and stirring address by Shri. Sachin Pilot- alumnus and, currently, the
Minister of State for Corporate Affairs- and the plethora of prizes and awards distributed by Shri.
Ajit Seth, the Cabinet Secretary, began that part of the “Dismissal Service” never before
witnessed- the Graduation Ceremony.
An unprecedented crowd of nearly 1000 people in attendance, the solemn ceremony unfolded
itself in a seamless fashion: an annual report, the liturgy of thanksgiving and commendation
administered by the Bishop of Delhi, two brief addresses by Junior Members, pledge-taking by
all outgoing students, preceded by a brief exhortation by the Principal . . .
Even the photo session on the Andrews Lawns was exhilarating.
The grass nearly caught fire!
Lunch on the Mess Lawns.
Sharing of food seemed sacramental!
It didn’t take long for reactions to pour in: “Why did you have to wait,” the caller from across
the Atlantic sounded aggrieved, “till my batch left the College to think of this splendid thing?”
How did all this happen?
Well, the magic wand was in the hands of the Students Union Society!
It was breathtaking to watch the SUS President and volunteers work over the last 3 days, putting
the various pieces of the jigsaw puzzle together, unveiling an unrivalled masterpiece! Kudos to
the SUS and its staff adviser Mr. Sanjay Rao Ayde.
