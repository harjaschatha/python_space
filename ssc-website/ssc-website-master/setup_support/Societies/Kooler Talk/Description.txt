Kooler Talk

ALL THE TALK THAT’S KOOL AND A LOT THAT’S NOT…

After the phenomenal success of Katy in 2009, the editorial ‘bored’ was looking to broaden its horizons and hopefully recruit someone out of history... we had one BIG success (waist size 40). Aunt Katherine felt healthier and stronger and decided to reproduce more; increasing her ‘issues’ from one p.a. to two p.a. The economic depression couldn’t prevent her growth. The Ed and Editor worked very hard on the Harmony issue, though the show was stolen by Pokemon. The second issue’s gestation period is almost over and the old triumvirate is back on track, with the Fairy’s blessings. We look forward to leaving college soon.
