Electronics Society

This year, the society started its activities with an electronics workshop by an eminent philosophy professor of our college, 
Prof. R .S. Nanda. He demonstrated three interesting circuits. Apart from that, there was a theoretical workshop by a student, Rahul 
Jha, II Physics. He instructed us on the basics of bread board electronics and how to start developing circuits from scratch. It was 
an extremely informative session which was enjoyed by the students. In the workshop, Rahul gave information on various types of logic 
gates, how to realize them on the bread board, operational amplifiers, different applications of 555 Timer,etc.

In the second term, a practical workshop was organized by two society members, Bahul Nautiyal and Varun Singh. They instructed the 
students on the practical approach to bread board electronics. The students were demonstrated the actual working of a circuit on 
bread board and were, afterwards, asked to make circuits on their own, which they completed successfully.

After that there was a soldering workshop by one of our society members, Shashank Kundu. He discussed the theory of the soldering 
components and then gave a practical demonstration of soldering.

In the future, the society plans to organize more workshops on diverse topics and a circuit making competition.
