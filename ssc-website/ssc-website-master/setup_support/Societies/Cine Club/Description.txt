The Cine Club
Having screened a grand total of six movies the previous year, this time round The Cine Club pulled up its virtual socks and succeeded in ridding itself of the defunct tag. The sudden deluge of movies was extensive , exhaustive and… well exhausting, at any rate. Just in the span of a term, we had screenings ranging from neo-noir (Majidi’s Turtles Can Fly) to the hilarious comedies of Monty Python (Life of Brian), striking a balance between popular and highbrow. Also on the list of screenings were Jarmusch’s Dead Man, Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs, Citizen Kane, and Everything is Illuminated. 

Taking to heart the wisecracks about the disparity between the size of the Executive Council and the actual work involved, our president Rajarshi decided to take matters into hand. And voila, we had a Cine Club fest – complete with movie screenings (Mr. and Mrs. Iyer, Bonnie and Clyde and Night on Earth), competitions, popcorn and an overarching theme of THE ROAD. Sadly it was only the popcorn that drew the crowds.

Innovation No. 2 that the club tried was the screening of movies after 4.30, and this policy proved to be a grand success, allowing an unprecedented number of sciencies to attend, given that all two of them turned up. Even the near zero temperatures in the AV room  (thanks to air conditioners which went into a flurry of activity in winter) did not deter some of our more enthusiastic  members who appeared smothered in woollens. There were second years so dedicated to the Club that their attendance at the screenings exceeded their cumulative attendance in classes.(Residence will miss you, Bud. )Did anyone say we aren’t popular?

Work was done,decisions were taken and here special thanks must go out to Shaman and Rajiv who lent their mind and voice (respectively) to the proceedings. Tara as the new President will hopefully continue this happy trend with the blessings of God (but of course) and the projector.Amen.
