The Physics Society
The Physics Society of St. Stephens’s College is a society set up to encourage and ignite the imaginations of our budding physicists. The society attempts to broaden the understanding of junior members by the various events it organizes throughout the year. The major event of the society is the ‘Popli Memorial Lectures Series’, for which an eminent physicist is invited to deliver a series of 3-4 lectures on a particular field of physics. The ‘Popli Memorial Aptitude Test’ and the ‘Meera Memorial Paper Presentation Competition’ play an important role in stimulating the interest of the members of our department. The society also organizes weekly lectures and presentations under the aegis of the Feynman Club. The Problem Solving club conducts regular problem solving sessions as well.
The Physics Society, through its activities makes every attempt to promote physics.
