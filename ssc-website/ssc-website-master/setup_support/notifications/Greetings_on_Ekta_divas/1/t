 LONG LIVE SARDAR PATEL AND THE SECULAR FABRIC OF INDIA

 
Dear Senior and Junior members of St. Stephen’s College.  The MHRD, the UGC and the University of Delhi have decided that 31st of October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhai Patel, be celebrated as “Ekta Diwas”.  St. Stephen’s College, through its history and culture, is in full sync with the quest for unity and national integration. And any occasion for promoting these cardinal values is welcome to us. For us, however, unity is not a sporadic excitement but a steady pursuit, a core value, basic to the ideal of life that we pursue together.

We are profoundly respectful of Sardar Patel’s incomparable contributions to the unity and integrity of India. We must celebrate this ‘iron man’ if only for the reason that such men are becoming rarer in our times. The ‘iron’ in this man was neither the might of the State, nor the muscle of crowds. It was strength of character and clarity of vision. It was the capacity to put the nation before the self. Patel understood, by the way, that unity in India calls for acceptance of diversity. He knew the difference between unity and uniformity. Strong men pursue unity. Insecure men clamour for uniformity. Uniformity undermines unity. It belies the soul of India, distorts the genius of our culture. 

Therefore, on this day as we respectfully and gratefully celebrate Sardar Patel and his historic, seminal contributions to the formation of modern India, we commit ourselves to the inclusive architecture of our polity and society. Happily, this is intrinsic to the ethos of our college. St. Stephen’s enfolds the variety and diversity of India. Students from all states and Union Territories find their academic home in our college. Sardar Patel, like Mahatma Gandhi, would have felt most at home in this college. He is one of us. In spirit, if not in substance. Jai Hind!
