THE BAWA BALWANT SINGH BHALLA AWARD
THE FIRST AWARDEE ANNOUNCED

I am delighted to announce that Parichay Mazumdar of IIIrd Year Physics (Hons.) has been
awarded the Bawa Balwant Singh Bhalla Award.
This prestigious award instituted this year by his children seeks to commemorate a
courageous and outstanding alumnus who, on the day of the Martyrdom of Bhagat Singh,
Rajguru and Sukhdev, risked his life and future prospects by hoisting the Indian National
Flag on the roof of St. Stephenâ€™s College, then situated in Kashmeri Gate. A spiritually deep
and enlightened soul, Bawa believed in the oneness of God and, hence, the need for religious
tolerance and universal brotherhood.
Tomorrow (28 November) being the birth anniversary of Bawa Balwant Singh Bhalla, it is
appropriate that the announcement on the first winner of this meaningful and prestigious
award is being made on that day.
The parameters used for selecting the awardee include high order of academic merit, spirit of
social service, outstanding contributions to the total life of the College and courteous
behavior.
I felicitate Parichay Mazumdar on winning this award.
