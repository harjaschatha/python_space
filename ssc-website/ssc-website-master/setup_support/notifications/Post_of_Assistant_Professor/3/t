 Please note that there will be no helpline or helpdesk available in the college for this purpose. However, a facilitation desk for the benefit of visually challenged applicants will function for two days every week on Fridays and Saturdays (2-4 pm), during the period of application, in the Internet Resource Centre (IRC), in the extension wing of the academic block of the college.

Please be advised that St. Stephen’s is a unique institution with a robust work culture and steadfast commitment to academic excellence. Its ethos is spiritual and its culture catholic and inclusive. Student-teacher relationship is of utmost importance in our idea of education. The life of the college is rich and vibrant. This is rendered possible by the eager willingness of faculty members to assume additional responsibilities in the sphere of extra-curricular activities. St. Stephen’s is hardly the place for those who do not have the desire to walk the extra mile.

I would urge you to take special note of the following-

1.    St. Stephen’s College, being a minority educational institution, is exempted from state policies on reservation with the sole exception of reservation for persons with disability.

2.     St. Stephen’s College reserves to itself the right not to fill all or some of the positions advertised.

3.    Any application made on the basis of wrong, false or incomplete data will be null and void. Selection or appointment made on the basis of such an application will be cancelled forthwith sans compensation.

4.    No applicant shall try to get in touch with the Principal or any faculty member or any other official of the college to lobby in his/her favour. Any attempt to influence the selection procedure shall result in the summary rejection of the concerned application.

Making faculty appointments is a significant and sacred responsibility. Its sanctity shall, in no wise, be compromised. 

With every good wish,

Sincerely

Rev. Dr. Valson Thampu

Principal
